<h1>WipeFile - Overview</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the program</h2>
<p><strong>WipeFile</strong> is a Windows utility designed to securely and permanently delete files and folders by overwriting their data - ensuring they cannot be recovered by data‑recovery tools. It is useful for privacy protection, secure disposal of sensitive files, or preparing drives before sale or transfer.</p>

<h2>Main features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Multiple secure‑wipe methods:</strong> WipeFile supports 14 different overwrite algorithms, including recognized standards such as U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Navy, NATO, and others - letting users choose the level of security depending on their needs.</li>
  <li><strong>File and folder deletion:</strong> Allows deletion of individual files or entire folders (and their contents) in one operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable & lightweight:</strong> Available as a small standalone executable - no installation required. Useful for running from USB drives or using on multiple PCs without setup.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast and simple interface:</strong> Easy drag‑and‑drop interface for selecting files/folders to wipe; minimal configuration for quick secure deletion.</li>
  <li><strong>Support for a wide range of Windows versions:</strong> Compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and newer (32‑ and 64‑bit) systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique aspects</h2>
<p>What distinguishes WipeFile from basic file deletion is its use of secure overwrite algorithms instead of simply deleting file pointers. By overwriting file data multiple times (depending on chosen method), it ensures that even advanced recovery tools cannot retrieve the original contents. The availability of many recognized standards (military, NATO, etc.) gives users flexibility in choosing the data‑destruction strength matching their privacy or security requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, WipeFile's portability makes it convenient for use on multiple machines without installation - a plus for IT professionals, technicians, or users handling multiple drives.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>WipeFile is aimed at users who value privacy and security - individuals who want to permanently erase sensitive documents, financial records, personal data, or any private files. It is also useful for users preparing to recycle, sell, or hand over storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, USB drives) and want to ensure no recoverable traces remain. IT professionals, privacy‑conscious users, and small offices with limited resources may find WipeFile effective for secure cleanup.</p>

<h2>Advantages of using WipeFile</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Permanent and secure deletion - overwritten files are essentially unrecoverable using standard undelete/recovery tools. </li>
  <li>Choice of secure deletion standards - from single simple overwrite to multi‑pass standards (DoD, NATO, etc.) - for flexibility depending on security needs. </li>
  <li>Freeware and portable - no installation, no cost, minimal resources required. </li>
  <li>Simple interface - easy to use even for non‑technical users. </li>
  <li>Works on various storage media - internal drives, external HDD/SSD, USB sticks, flash drives or other removable media.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional modules & workflow</h2>
<p>The basic workflow of WipeFile involves: selecting files or folders you wish to remove, choosing a wipe method (algorithm) from the list of supported methods, and executing the wipe. The program overwrites the sectors used by the file/folder with random or pattern-based data multiple times as defined by the algorithm, then removes the directory entries - making file recovery virtually impossible.</p>
<p>No installation is required - simply run WipeFile executable, drag and drop files, confirm the wipe, and let the program process. Its small size and portable nature allow usage from USB or external drives.</p>

<h2>Technical requirements & supported platforms</h2>
<p>WipeFile supports Windows operating systems including Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and later versions. Both 32‑bit and 64‑bit editions are supported.</p>
<p>The program is extremely lightweight (under 150 KB), requires negligible memory and no special hardware; it runs on virtually any PC or laptop.</p>
<p>The software works with internal and external storage media (HDD, SSD, USB drives, memory cards) - any storage recognized by Windows as a drive or removable media can be processed.</p>

<h2>Limitations and considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>WipeFile may not include advanced features such as scheduled wiping or automated background shredding - its interface is simple and manual.</li>
  <li>The default interface language may not be English - some builds require switching language in settings.</li>
  <li>WipeFile does not guarantee secure deletion on SSDs or flash-based storage the same way as on traditional HDDs, due to wear‑leveling and mapping mechanisms - like many secure‑delete tools, overwrite methods are more reliable on magnetic disks than on solid‑state media. (This is a general limitation for file‑shredders on SSDs; see remarks on secure deletion tools vs SSD behavior.)</li>
  <li>No built-in scheduling, batch automation, or disk‑free‑space wiping - user must select files manually each time.</li>
  <li>The project seems discontinued - official sources note that WipeFile is no longer maintained, which may affect future compatibility or security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical use cases & scenarios</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Secure deletion of sensitive documents (financial records, personal data, identity scans) before disposing or selling a PC. </li>
  <li>Cleaning USB drives or external disks before sharing or repurposing - ensuring no recoverable data remains. </li>
  <li>Removing traces of confidential files or folders when upgrading or decommissioning computers. </li>
  <li>Temporary data cleanup to ensure privacy on shared or public computers. </li>
  <li>Data sanitization before discarding or recycling storage media, or before handing hardware to third parties. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Security and data protection context</h2>
<p>Simply deleting files in Windows does not remove the actual data - it merely removes pointers. WipeFile ensures secure data destruction by overwriting file content with patterns or random data multiple times before deletion, preventing common recovery tools from restoring the original files.</p>
<p>For maximum security (especially before disposing of storage media), it's recommended to use WipeFile on magnetic HDDs; for SSDs or flash-based drives, encryption or secure‑erase commands from the drive manufacturer may provide better guarantees. WipeFile remains a useful tool for conventional drives. (As with many file shredders, limitations apply depending on storage technology.)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>WipeFile is a simple, portable, and free Windows utility for secure file and folder deletion with multiple overwrite methods. It is suitable for users who need to ensure that deleted data cannot be recovered - whether for privacy, security, or hardware disposal. While the program lacks advanced automation or scheduling, its portability, flexibility in wipe methods, and ease of use make it a practical choice for quick secure deletions on HDDs or external drives. Given its apparent lack of recent updates, users should consider their storage types (HDD vs SSD) and security needs when relying on WipeFile for data sanitization.</p>
